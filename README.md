6) when the equals button is pressed you should display the result of the last entered calculation
7) the program should use functions, loops, DOM selectors and DOM events

## Difficulties
There was the initial panic and confusion when told the homework, most likely due to tiredness. However after resting for a bit and eating, the solutions came into my head fairly easily and became very straight forward. The only difficulty was knowing what DOM event to use, as I confused getElement.. and querySelector mixed up.

## Pleased
* Added a zero button
* Managed to calculate more than one input

__Managed to accomplish all in the list__
